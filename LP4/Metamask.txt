Problem Statement:
Installation of MetaMask and Study of Spending Ether per Transaction

In this practical, you will:

Install the MetaMask wallet to interact with Ethereum or other compatible blockchain networks.
Understand how to spend Ether for transactions using MetaMask.
Observe the gas fees (Ether spending) required for performing transactions.
Step-by-Step Process:
1. Install MetaMask Wallet:
MetaMask is a browser extension that allows users to interact with Ethereum-based applications directly from the browser. Follow these steps to install MetaMask:

Steps:

Open a web browser (preferably Google Chrome, Brave, or Firefox).
Visit the official MetaMask website: MetaMask Website
Click on Download and choose the appropriate version for your browser.
Once installed, MetaMask will appear as an extension in your browser toolbar.
2. Set Up MetaMask:
After installation, set up your wallet:

Open the MetaMask extension by clicking on the MetaMask icon in the toolbar.
Click Get Started.
Select Create a Wallet and follow the instructions.
You will be given a secret recovery phrase. Save it securely! This is the only way to recover your wallet.
Set a strong password for the wallet.
3. Connect MetaMask to a Test Network:
Ether (ETH) on the main Ethereum network has real-world value. For testing, we will use test networks (e.g., Goerli or Ropsten) to interact without spending real ETH.

Steps:

Open MetaMask and click on the network dropdown (usually says "Ethereum Mainnet" by default).
Select Goerli Test Network or Ropsten Test Network. If you don't see it, enable it by:
Click on Settings (in MetaMask).
Go to Advanced Settings and enable Show Test Networks.
Return to the network dropdown and select Goerli Test Network or any other test network.
4. Get Free Test Ether:
On test networks, you can get free Ether using faucets:

Search for Goerli Faucet or Ropsten Faucet on a search engine.
Enter your MetaMask wallet address on the faucet page to request free test ETH.
After a few minutes, check your MetaMask balance to see the test ETH credited.
5. Send Ether (Test ETH) from MetaMask:
Now that you have test ETH in your wallet, you can send Ether to another account or smart contract. Follow these steps to send a transaction:

Steps:

Click on Send in MetaMask.
Enter the recipient's wallet address (you can send to another account or a friend on the same test network).
Enter the amount of Ether (e.g., 0.1 ETH).
MetaMask will show an estimated gas fee, which is the fee you pay for the transaction.
Click Next and then Confirm to send the transaction.
6. Study Gas Fees for Transactions:
Every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain requires gas, which is paid in Ether. The gas fee depends on two factors:

Gas Limit: The maximum amount of gas you are willing to spend for the transaction.
Gas Price: The price per unit of gas, which fluctuates based on network demand.
MetaMask automatically estimates the gas fee for you. Once the transaction is complete, you can:

Check the transaction details by clicking on the Activity tab in MetaMask.
View the transaction on a block explorer (like Etherscan) to see the exact gas used and the total cost.
Example:

If you send 0.1 ETH and the gas fee is 0.002 ETH, the total amount deducted from your account will be 0.102 ETH.
7. Observe Gas Fees for Smart Contract Interactions:
Interacting with smart contracts (like deploying contracts or calling contract functions) requires more computational resources, so these transactions will have higher gas fees compared to simple Ether transfers.

Deploy a smart contract (like the student data contract you created earlier).
After deploying, check the gas fee spent on MetaMask or Etherscan.
When you call functions (like adding a student), observe the gas fees for these operations.
